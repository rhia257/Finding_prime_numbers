# Prime Number Finder in Python

## Description
Python script to find all prime numbers between 2 and 1,000,000 using a set-based implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  
The script calculates the total number of primes and identifies the largest prime in the range.

## Features
- Efficiently finds all primes between 2 and a given number.
- Calculates the total count of prime numbers.
- Determines the largest prime number in the range.

## How It Works
1. Creates a set of numbers from 2 up to the desired limit (`n = 1,000,000`).
2. Iteratively selects the smallest number from the set as a prime.
3. Removes all multiples of that prime from the set.
4. Repeats until all numbers are processed.
5. Outputs the total count of primes and the largest prime.

## Usage
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the script in Python 3.
3. Run the script.
